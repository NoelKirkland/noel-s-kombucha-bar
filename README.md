# Noel's Kombucha Bar

## By Noel Kirkland - 9/11/2020

## Description
This is a web application that helps a kombucha bar owner keep track of the kombucha that currently have on tap as well as how many pints are left in each keg. The application allows the user to add a keg of kombucha with details like, name, brand, price per pint, and flavor profile. The user can see a list of all the kombucha kegs they have added. The user can then click on any of the list kegs to see that kombucha's details. The user can also click a button to sell a single pint or enter a custom amount of pints they have sold  and they will see the total pints left in the keg decrease.

## User stories

* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.

* As a user, I want to be able to enter how many pints of I have sold from a particular keg and see that accurately reflected in that keg's total pints left. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
